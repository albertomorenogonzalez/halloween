This font is from Brain Eaters Font Co. Fonts based on B-Movies, Horror, Sci-Fi, Exploitation and other trash. 
I first saw this font style on an old Hammer Films production. I forget the actual title of the movie, so I chose this seemingly appropriate name. An old english style font, or if you prefer gothic, dripping with blood!
